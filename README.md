# COMPRESO - File Compressor Application
COMPRESO is a file compression application developed as part of a Data Structures and Algorithms project. The application utilizes Huffman Encoding compression technique to significantly reduce file sizes while maintaining data integrity.

## Features

- **Efficient Compression:** COMPRESO employs Huffman Encoding to achieve up to 70% reduction in file sizes, making it an effective solution for optimizing storage and data transfer.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** The application is built using Java Swing, offering a user-friendly graphical interface for easy interaction and compression of files.

- **Collaborative Development:** COMPRESO was developed by a dedicated 4-member team, leveraging our collective skills in Java programming, algorithms, and UI design.

## How It Works

1. **File Selection:** Users can choose the file they want to compress using the intuitive file picker interface.

2. **Compression:** COMPRESO's underlying algorithm employs Huffman Encoding to analyze the frequency of characters in the selected file and generates an optimal compression codebook.

3. **Decompression:** The compressed file can be decompressed using the same application, ensuring that the original data is accurately restored.
